2,Shake Shack near the museum would probably be right up your alley.
2,"I hate to burst your bubble, but the day you have planned is totally unrealistic. It will take 4-5 hrs. minimum to tour SOL/Ellis Island and by then you'll be exhausted. Your best bet is probably to eat at Ellis Island or near Battery Park on your return and forget about the museum. Gigino's Wagner Park is an Italian rest. with views of the Statue. They also have a kids' menu.  menupages.com/restaurants/gigino-wagner-park/    Maybe the kids will be interested in going to the park after lunch, but I'd suggest doing something else downtown in the afternoon. Maybe head over to the lower east side to the Tenement Museum and then to Economy Candy."
1,"NYWhiz makes a good point, as always. Also, have you booked your tickets for the SOL and Ellis Island yet? Crown tickets are very hard to get unless you book far in advance."
2,Another recent addition to that area is Inatteso on West Street--- It is an upscale pizza place and owned by the same people as Adrienne's on Stone street that always gets good grades. I have been thoroughly disappointed in Gigino's the last few times there even though if you sit outside having the SOL in your sites is pretty cool. One other suggestion would be Zetuna's which is more like you described but no pizza--
2,The Irish Hunger Memorial is pretty nearby as well if you think you and your family would find that interesting:    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Hunger_Memorial    nymag.com/listings/
0,"Wow! Thanks for the quick responses. Yes, we knew to get our crown tickets already, thanks to many months of lurking on this forum. We secured our tickets back in June and I am very glad.     The Tenement Museum and Economy Candy sounds like a great idea too. My kids may not want to see the Natural History museum anyway after 5 days in Washington DC prior to our arrival there. We actually had planned 7 days in DC and I wanted so much to go up to the crown, so we decided to do 5 in DC and 2 in NYC. I will be doing a lot of scouting around to plan a much longer trip in the near future.    Thanks for all the restaurant suggestions. I am so overwhemed by how much NYC has to offer. I will look into all of them."
1,"Do the natural history museum in DC. While I love the AMNH, with your limited time I'd do something different here."
2,"I wouldn't reco Gigino's in Wagner Park if you're looking for a casual place with pizza. It's a gorgeous restaurant with great food and a great view, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't sound like what you're looking for.    Instead, if you're going to eat after the SOL/Ellis, I'd reco P.J. Clarke's or SouthwestNY, which are both in the World Financial Center and more casual.    On the UWS, I always reco Big Nick's Pizza and Burgers for folks with kids, on B'way near 77th Street. It's ain't the prettiest place, but the menu is endless and their burgers are big, juicy and cheap! A real crowd-pleaser.    www.menupages.com/restaurants/big-nicks/    Another good place for kids and adults is Vynl. I personally prefer the original location on 9th Aenue, but the others are fine. Great bathrooms, good food, good cocktails.    www.vynl-nyc.com    NOTE: NO FREE REFILLS ON SODA/POP OR ICED TEA IN NYC!! It's just not customary here. I have no idea 
why; that's just the way it is.    In NYC, it's common to get free refills on our (healthy and tasty) tap water, and on hot coffee or tea. (Yep, no need to waste $$ on bottle water. Bring your own bottle and fill from the tap.)"
2,"In our FAQ "";thumbtack""; at the top of this forum is this collection of nightlife websites.     tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k1277535  Scroll through all the pages and you'll find some good website for door lists, such as VelvetList, Rhythmism and ClubPlanet."
1,"Okay Tannie ..... (gawd bless your soul it's a excruciatingly boring day on the forum, so where would we be without you) ..... now try to follow me with this;   Hmmmm ..... well ..... if you're "";hot""; ..... then wouldn't any place you go by definition be a "";hot new club""; ..... see where I'm going with this one? See ..... pretty cool right ..... or maybe just try Santos House Party    http://www.santospartyhouse.com/"
1,actually I mean by that what club is happening as many of them are open and SUCK and there are always a couple that have the good crowds djs ect.
1,And what qualifications can you offer that would allow us to believe that you indeed deserve this special treatment.. I'll give you a hint it needs to be more than you are from Chicago.....
0,Now Tannie ..... you do realize that the weekend you're talking about is Labor Day weekend? A lot of locals are out of town for the last long weekend of summer (btw ..... it's supposed to be nice weather) and school starts like on Tuesday? I would hazard to guess that most places will be fairly deserted except for tourist. The subway this morning was so empty it looked just like New Jersey.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVAOrWUcrM
1,any where you travel you can get on a guest list if the promoters what people at their clubs they do it here in chicago...ive gotten on for la and vegas so dont know why it would be hard in NYC
1,"because in LA and Las Vegas, its about the money. Here, its about the exclusivity."
2,Take a few minutes to read the Club articles and reviews on Time Out NY. I would trust them.    http://newyork.timeout.com/section/clubs
1,Come on evening--- no one is more exclusive than you. Help the poor girl out will you.... get her on a few lists.     Tannie- I am working on it for you and I should have confirmation back this evening that you are on the list for Grays Papaya -- a hot new club on 72nd and Broadway. Jusr show up and use evening's name.
2,"unlike some people I dont reply to posts when I dont know the answer. Why I can explain to Tannie why clubs here are not like LA and Las Vegas, I wouldnt begin to suggest where what I'm guessing a 20something year old should go. And, the 20somethings I know would kill me if I gave away their hot spots.    The most exclusive place in NYC right now is across the street from my office and neither Tannie, nor I would be getting in there anytime soon (all my Vanity Fair connections are in ad sales)    And, Bilmin - I was right about Eliot Spitzer too."
1,And all this time evening I thought you were a 20 something ! Let me know when you would like to go to that club--- I'll get you in.     Oh yes Elliot is such a wonderful role model for all   New Yorkers.
0,"all I said was he was getting ready for another election... will leave the moral issues to his wife, and the hookers"
2,they are not best for transportation but for seeing sites - the subway is best for transportation around the city.    Grayline are very popular but very busy
2,"thanks..I know the subway is easier . .but the multiple levels of steps and such are harder on hubby's knees ..and we're hoping to see more of teh "";outer areas""; ..like Chinatown.. and the WTC .. which isnt even on the subway route. I'l have to check grey line out more"
2,"There is a flight of steps to clamber up/down on the HOHO buses so that isn't ideal. How about simply using a City bus (1-day "";fun pass""; Metrocard is just $8.25/person) -- and the free mini-bus shuttle service offered by the Downtown Alliance? Those buses are fully air-conditioned and you need to make only 1 step up/down.  www.downtownny.com/gettingaround/?sid=19  downtownny.com/images/ute_map.html"
2,"Why on earth do you think the WTC and Chinatown are "";outer areas?""; Do you think the thousands of people who worked in the WTC walked to work each day? They are both well served by subways. It's not like the subway only runs in midtown.    City buses will be easier on your husband's knees than HOHO buses - city buses "";kneel""; and the newer ones have essentially no steps inside, just one small step from the curb onto the low bus floor.     And yes, the WTC and Chinatown are both well served by city bus routes as well."
1,"THAT's why I love these forums. . Much cheaper and better option .. .I've printed the "";free shuttle""; ..where can I find a map for the Metro pass?"

1,"I am trying to get directions to E. 35 St. Marina on HopStop.com and it does not recognize this address.   We will be staying at the Affina Dumont, 150 E. 34th St.   Can someone give me guidance on where exactly E. 35 St. Marina is?   Also, do you know how long this ride will take? Approx how long on water taxi and then approx how long on the bus. IT does look like a fun alternative to the subway or LIRR."
1,35th Street Marina is located at East 35th Street and the FDR Drive. Cross the FDR Drive going East and you will see the marina. The ferry takes 35 to 45 minutes and the shuttle bus takes about 10 minutes max. Have fun.
0,NYC22222--welcome to the NYC Forum.
0,I was wondering are nyc 10025 and nyc 22222 related ?
0,I doubt it.
2,I rode the Water taxi. It went very smoothly and was a fun way to get to the US Open. It was a beautiful Sat morning. The subway was very crowded and took about the same amount of time. The water taxi was very relaxing and a fun way to see the skyline. There was no line to get on and the buses were ready to take us to the Open. The Powerade sponsors were there and they gave each of us a Powerade and we used this to refill with water at the open!    Have fun. Thanks for the great tip.
2,We rode it Sunday afternoon. The boat was about 1/10 full. It took us up to a marina within sight of the famous globe in Flushing Meadows. It was a wonderful experience although my son got nauseous on the boat. Good thing we decided not to buy the 2-day WaterTaxi Hop On/Hop Off pass!
1,From the Affinia Dumont you can walk. Head east to the river and walk up one block. Go to  maps.google.com  for walking directions. Type affinia dumont nyc to east 35 th st. marina nyc in the top.
2,"Not that I know of, but you can get the AirTrain at JFK to the Long Island RailRoad, which will take you directly to Penn Station, from which you can take an Amtrak directly to Philadelphia. To save some money, you could instead take a New Jersey Transit train from Penn Station to Trenton, and from there get a SEPTA regional rail train (the R7 line) directly into Philadelphia. To save EVEN more money, instead of taking the LIRR from JFK to Penn Station, you could take the subway.     I know that probably sounds very confusing, but if you let us know your budget and the day and time you expect to arrive at JFK, I'll plot it all out for you and send you links to the schedules and fares."
2,"I will arrive on 21 Oct 2009 1310. prefer quickest and more direct way. Is there coach call "";Wah Fung""; at China Town (New York) which directly go to Philadelphia. And what is the travel time for different method ??  thanks"
2,"The name of the bus is "";Fung Wah"";. I would not recommend using them, as I regularly pass their broken buses sitting on the side of the road during our trips between Boston and New York."
2,"However, there are plenty of other bus companies that run between NYC and Philly, including ones which pick up directly outside Penn Station (if you take the LIRR in)... Bolt Bus and MegaBus have both been okay in my experience."
1,"Bolt Bus was great. I know a lot of people who take Fung Wa and the other Chinatown buses, but I'm reluctant after all the accidents."
2,"Amtrak will be faster than the bus, but if you prefer a bus, Take either Bolt Bus or Mega Bus. Both will take you from Penn Station to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. Both will take 2 hours (plus any additional traffic time). Megabus has seats available for your date now ($5). BoltBus doesn't have tickets available for that date yet, but when they do go on sale, they're likely to cost the same or less. The fares for both companies will get more expensive the closer you get to your date.     Amtrak will take you from Penn Station to 30th Street Station in under an hour and a half, but will cost more - the cheapest fare I see for your date right now is $34. That will also get more expensive as we get closer to your date."
2,"Here is their website with all their info, hours, etc.:    http://www.tdf.org/TDF_ServicePage.aspx?id=56    Other pointers:    * Sold out shows like Jersey Boys, Lion King and South Pacific are never (if ever) sold at TKTS booths. For those shows, use a website like www.broadwaybox.com .     Try to avoid using ticket brokers. They are rip-offs.    * You can see what was selling at the booths each previous week, from their website above.    * The lines at the South Street Seaport booth are shorter than Times Square, and the one in Downtown Brooklyn is even less crowded.    * If you have an idea of shows you want to see, print out their seating charts and bring them to the TKTS booth. The clerks will tell you general sections of what they have.    * If you can, sit separately. Tell the clerk. You might be able to get better seats sitting alone.    * Don't let the clerks or long lines behind you pressure you. Take your time.    Here is our Theater Info page from our FAQ "";pushpin""; at 
the top of this forum.    BROADWAY! Discount tickets and theatre etiquette: Never pay full price and turn off that cell phone!    tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-c1146/New-York"
1,"P.S. How was your trip here last week? Did I overlook your trip report? Did you run your family into the ground, and turn their feet into bloody stumps? ;o)"
2,"No, you didn't miss it . . . still owe you all one and do intend to get it posted soon. In short, Had a great rainy day day-trip-- so great that I jumped right into our December weekend planning. You guys are truly the best-- I can't imagine feeling confident about any of the 4 adventures we've had there having had first picked your brains!! Thanks for the TKTS info-- can't wait to digest it. Woulk like to feel as though I'm a smart, seasoned NYC shopper-- not just the love-sick, impulsive one I am now!"
2,"We don't have Boxing Day here so you'll have no problem with train service or cabs. On holidays, such as New Year's Day, the trains run on holiday schedules (not sure what you mean by double times?), which are less frequent but still regular. What train are you planning to take? The AirTrain/subway? I don't think that'd cause much of a problem - leave a little extra time but not a big deal."
2,Thanks for the quick reply.    When I said double time I meant in the UK cab/taxi's charge double time/fare on bank holidays. Thats good to know.   I got a cab from JFK last time and was fine. To save a few pounds for the hotel I wouldnt mind getting the air train/subway.    Thanks ginger-candy.
2,"Cabs in NYC do not charge extra on holidays; they charge the same fare that they charge on other days. "";Boxing Day""; is not any kind of holiday at all in the US; no one here observes it, and most people born here have never even heard of it. If you ask about "";boxing day""; hours or "";boxing day""; closures, all you can expect is a puzzled look. (The same, by the way, is true for "";Easter Monday"";, and we also do not use the term "";bank holiday""; here either.)"
1,"Ahhh....but those of us who work at banks do, indeed, use the term "";bank holiday"";! Most especially for Columbus Day, Veterans Day, and other such holidays that might not be observed by anyone other than banks and the postal service!"
2,Take the AirTrain and LIRR.
2,"The only thing to be concerned about with boxing day is that it's also a Saturday this year, and the trains do run somewhat less frequently on Saturdaty. But not so that it'll cause you any problems."
1,"Thanks for all your replies, you have been a great help."
2,"You don't say which airport you're coming from, so I am generalising a bit here..     It should take no more than 90 minutes to get from either JFK or EWR to your hotel. (I'm unsure if you're staying at the Marriot Marquis, as you just say "";midtown hotel""; or just going for a buffet!!).    Anyway, 2pm - 3.45pm to get to hotel, give yourself an hour and a quarter to get freshened up, changed, and relax which makes it now 5pm.     So, IMO, you've actually got 3 hours before the tickets at 8pm, (give or take half an hour, as you'll probably have to get their earlier.     As I said, these are huge generalisations, as I'm unsure what airport, and what transportation options you're taking, and also where you're actually staying."
2,Flying into LGA and staying at the Benjamin. The whole family was in NY in June so we still remember how to get around pretty well and still have current maps of subway ect. My daughter and I are in love with NY and couldn't wait to get back.
1,How long will you be in the City? Perhaps you should save thew Marriott for another time - when you will not have to rush.  Just a thought.  Poppa
0,You should have no trouble with that time frame.
2,Please tell me that you got your tickets on broadway box and did not pay full price for them... I would wait till after the show or another day to go to the Marriott Marquis if you think your daughter will like it. Just grab something lite before the show either near the theater or near your hotel. You don't want to have to rush out of the lounge if your daughter is really into it.. Ps at 15 I bet she already feels very grown up just ask her..    You will have no problem with your timetable unless there are major weather delays on your flight. So if on time just relax and take it easy.
1,"Thanks everyone for the info. No Bilmin I didn't pay full price. I rarely pay full price for anything if I can help it-it gives me a headache, LOL. Happy Labor Day. Have a good one."
2,"HI, DERBY -- the walk from the Benjamin to the Marriott Marquis shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes, although you may decide to stop to ogle St. Patrick's Cathedral and/or Rockefeller Center en route; the Winter Garden Theatre is just 4-1/2 blocks from the Marquis.     So barring horrific delay at LGA, you should be fine. The buffet at the Marriott isn't so expansive or fabulous that you'll need anywhere close to 2 hours to do it justice :-)"
2,Getting from LGA to your hotel should not take long. So you should have plenty of time to go to the Marriot Marquis for the buffet. I have heard the view is great have not done this personally.I envy you and your daughter.I took my 14 year old last Febuary and we fell in love with New York. As life changes aka job i am now having to spend time on both coasts so now next Febuary my daughter is coming to the city so we can enjoy the city again.Have fun on your trip. Please write a trip report. I love to read about other mother daughter trips.
1,"Yes, the subway is the best way to get around. I would rather have a hot poker stuck in my eye than shop the Friday after Thanksgiving, but if you're here to shop you will have company."
2,"Hi cailin,  As I don't know what kind of things you like to do, can't really advise you too much. Museums, park, Empire State, Top of the Rock, bridges... Maybe read the sections to the side of this page on things to do, and the FAQs to get ideas to get you started. As you mentioned shopping, I wouldn't bother going to Jersey Gardens, there are usually good sales in the city in much more pleasant surroundings. But that's just me! However, I do believe that Woodbury Common has more stores than Jersey Gardens. If you use the search box just above this thread, you will get more info. The search box is your friend, no matter what you might be able to think of asking, you will find previous threads on the topic.  Most definitely, use the subway for your travelling around the city. Buy a 7 day ticket, about $27 dollars, can be used on buses ans subways and is the best value item you will buy!"
1,"Oh, yes, just saw that you are there for that Friday... Well, get your body armour on, the shops will be packed! But, on the other hand, there will be sales too!"
0,thanks for your suggestions i have friends who went to jersey gardens last year for the black friday sales and reckon it was better than woodbury common. granted it was manic. is manhattan itself better for the bargains? also just reading bout the real new yorker walking tours. they sound great thinking it might be a good idea for the thursday. any feedback?
2,"Well, there seem to be always sales of some sort in the department stores. If in Macy's or Bloomingdales, go to the visitors' centre and get a dicount card which will get you 11% off most items except cosmetics and some clothing concessions."
1,i'll be at the baseball game on Monday too!!!!     Have a great trip!
2,Congratulations to your son for his admission to Princeton and to you for getting him there! Enjoy your trip! Moms
2,Jillian --  Daughter is Princeton '06. Hope your son loves it as much as she did !
2,All the best to you and the family. Have a safe journey and enjoy yourselves. Take lots of pictures! Weather report is not great for the weekend but looks gorgeous for Mon.!
1,Are you leaving the car in Princeton and taking the train in. Probably makes the most sense.. Train from Princeton goes right into the city.
1,When in P'town you might want to raise a glass of beer at the Triumph Brewery...    www.triumphbrewing.com/indexSPLASH.html    Great food and micro-brews. The pumpkin ale is ready.    Pjk
1,Congrats to the Princeton student. He'll love it and you'll enjoy visiting. My niece just graduated from there and she's now in a fully funded PHD program at Harvard!    ENJOY! the city - just hang out
2,"we made it...LATE last night...rain rain rain all thru the mountains. I don't like Pennsylvania anymore. checked into the Hampton Inn, only to find a flat tire! when we left to get dinner. A very nice young man from Mass changed it for us, because my son nor I know how to do it...We do now, already his Princeton education has begun...weather looks better for tomorrow when we depart for Manhattan...I am so ready to ditch this rental car...and hit the city streets!"
1,"Yes...I am leaving the car at Princeton Junction, I hope it is safe there as it is a rental, and yes I needed those beers at Triump last night, but had several at "";On the Border""; and the hotel sells bottles 24/7 ....how cool is that"
0,"Oh, I forgot to add, stay is for 8 nights, end of April, therefore could I expect prices to drop further at those 2 places or is it recommended that I just book now?"
2,"They're both trendy boutique hotels moderately priced with very compact rooms. RM Grace has the lobby bar which evidently can get loud and raucous on weekends. You don't say how many you are, how long you're visiting or when, but it's typical here to book without prepaying and make a cancelable reservation should rates drop nearer your trip. Neither of these would be my choice b/c rooms are just too small and claustrophic but our tastes/priorities are obviously different.    As for being near the "";action""; it depends on what action you mean. Most first time tourists think of Times Square as the center of the action and it really isn't except for tourists and theater. The Best Western Hanbee, for example, would be closer to the young trendy areas of the city where locals would go."
1,"I love the fact that they are so modern and trendy, I don't like as much that they do seem quite small.    There are 2 of us (couple) travelling, end of April for 8 nights.    The reason I was thinking of booking so soon is that I'm from Australia and the exchange rate for us is very strong at the moment so I didn't want to miss the boat.  I would usually book through expedia.com.au who offer a $30 cancellation fee (in which case I would book, then cancel should something better come up, then re-book elsewhere etc), however both hotels are not listed on there yet. Also Room Mate Grace have a non-refundable which is significantly cheaper than the refundable option."
0,At this point for that time of year I would go with the refundable option since there very well could be sales at even those hotels. I faced a similar decision on a recent trip to Italy and I booked the refundable which was 30 euro more per night but by the time I ended up booking I got the same room for 50 euro less and they threw in a dinner for two and some other things. Refundable this far in advance is always the best option. Non Refundable is always the best option when you are close to your date and there is absolutely no chance that you will change your dates or your hotel.
1,"Oh wow, I can't wait to experience the TOTR at sunset in December. For now, I can only imagine...    bb"
1,I'd like to go to the Chelsea markets. What kind of lunch did you have there?
2,"Chelsea markets is an area of specialist food shops and serve your self cafes.. We had soup and sandwiches, but there was the usual pitza slices, Italian sandwiches, wraps etc..and a faboulous fish market that had yummy lobster for sale for lunch, as well as other seafood to eat as you go..There is also a really nice bakery that bakes the bread on site... All nice lunch stuff, but no fancy restuarants or even waiter service,but nice food and a good atmosphere to sit and watch the world go by.Almost forgot..fab. cup cakes yummy.. Enjoy.. We really enjoyed our walk on the high line, and accessable just by chelsea markets. Have a great trip."
1,"Thank you Chrissy for highlighting the High Line,I hadnt heard of this before so looked it up and it looks great. We are going in November for daughters 18th and i have added this to our itinerary. Although I have to be honest and say that the cupcakes was all i needed to hear!!    I have found a map of the high line. Am i right in thinking that if you get tired (i have arthritis so cant walk for hours) you can get off part way through the walk and how long would it take to walk the whole thing as i could meet everyone at the end if they want to do the full walk.    thanks again  sharron"
1,"Yes you can get off. We did no problems, plus there are plenty of seats for you to have a rest. Enjoy"
0,"thats great, thank you"
1,"gociba, keep in mind that the High Line is right off the Hudson River, and in November, it will get quite windy. It often feels colder there than the rest of Manhattan. Dress appropriately!"
0,Ok thank you for that i'd better take my thermals!!    kind regards  sharron
1,"Glad to hear you liked the sound of the highline, we enjoyed it, mainly because it was such a contrast in a busy city...You can get off at various places along the way, although im not sure exactly where.. Its not completed yet so the walk isnt that long, but maybe since August a little more is finished.. There is disabled access at some places, y0u may need to track those down because there are quite a few steps to enter, but there is an elevator at 14th street. How nice to celebrating your daughters 18th in NY enjoy your time together..."
2,Good early--- bad later ever since the current management has taken over even though it was the same family and now they are starting to stiff their suppliers. I would say to avoid the place for the next year or so while the regime changes.
2,"Three of my girlfriends and I were planning on going to the Sunday brunch on Dec. 20th. Is the brunch any good?    We want to experience it during the holidays, but don't want to totally waste our money if the food and service are horrible.    Was planning on making reservations next week...    bb"
2,"Good riddance to bad rubbish. The current management team ruined the place, and it'll be better to have a restauranteur who has a proven track record of actually serving good food in a park restaurant instead of just acting as a tourist trap."
1,"bayou babe - have you read any recent reviews of TOTG? Or any threads about it here on this forum. The popular wisdom gives it a thumbs down for food.    www.menupages.com    www.newyork.citysearch.com      Sure, you can go have a drinks and take photos. Knock yourselves out.    What kinds of food, price and atmo do you want?"
2,"Hi Queens,     Yes, I have read some of the reviews but I guess I was in denial. Thanks for keeping it real for me. We have all heard so many good things about TOTG from family that has visited in the past, but it was probably during those "";good ole days"";.    I definitely will reecommend to my friends that we do drinks and take some snapshots, so we can put a check by TOTG on our "";must do""; list and move on to better things.    We will be going to see Wicked on Thurs, Dec 17th, and instead of Sunday brunch on TOTG, I think we should focus on pre or post dinner plans for Thursday night. A level above casual dining, but it doesn't have to be the finest of dining, anything but French, and around $50 pp not including drinks. A prix fixe menu would be good! And somewhere that locals frequent...    Thanks for your help!    bb"
0,Sad to here that TOTG has gone bust.    Had a very nice meal there a few years ago!    :(
2,Babe-- make sure you take your pictures early. The last day of their license is 12-31-09 which means you will be there in the last week of their operation and given the acrimonious way they have been thrown out of the park I would not expect any kind of service from there.... There are so many other places in the city deserving of your time and attention do not waste a minute on this place.
2,Babe the following are in the theater district they are all on the same block 46th street between 8th and 9th avenues... and if you venture just a little further down to 9th avenue there are scores of very affordable restaurants of all types.     www.restaurantrownyc.com
2,"I hate to be the one to say this, but I think that the old girl needs a facelift. The potential for elegance is great, but 1) the menu needs an update and 2) the decor isn't competing the way it should with the very modern designs found in other chi-chi places. Its location has no parallel, but it isn't keeping up with the Joneses."
0,"Tacky, tacky, tacky."
1,"bilmin, thanks for the advice and the restaurant row link. I see some good choices to run by my girlfriends...    Think I may walk by TOTG and take a picture from the outside.    If they get their act together after the takeover, maybe I will venture inside at a later date ;-)    bb"
0,actual dates of travel please
1,"Are you arriving here in just a few weeks or are you planning for October 2010? If you'll be here shortly, please give us the dates of your anticipated stay.     Fair warning: hotel rates are high in the fall here, and you literally can't afford to be picky at this point, assuming you intend to arrive soon. So be prepared to be flexible :-)"
1,"Hey everyone.      We are flying in 9 October and flying out 21 October.       Reading through the other posts i have looked at Affinia Shelbourne, affinia Dumont, Gem Chelsea, Hotel 79.      If there are hotels in other areas that you may think meet my criteria, we're flexible.      Cheers,      E"
2,I loved the Affinia Dumont.    Its a block from the subway stop that will get you anywhere (via connections )to anywhere you want to go in NYC.  Rooms are super clean and the kitchens are super handy.There is a drug store and a Deli with awsome salads close by.    The lobby smells like fresh cut flowers.  Its not so much modern furnishings but the view...  If you look at their Trip Advisor thing i posted a picture from my window.  I want to go back.......
2,"Since you'll be here for almost 2 weeks (12 nights, not 10, am I right?), think you would be best served by an apartment-style/suites hotel with kitchenette facilities and a bit more space.     Living out of a suitcase for 12 nights in a room the size of most NYC hotels wouldn't be fun (and the GEM rooms are tighter quarters than many). Plus, having a kitchenette means you won't have to go out all the time for every meal, and drinks. So it actually can save you money.    Any of the Affinia properties would be fine, but they're almost all beyond your budget for those dates. The Eastgate Tower, an Affinia property, is within your price range via Quikbook; its decor, however, may be too dated for you."
2,"I think you have to forget about picking an area and find a hotel that will suit you at that budget for those dates. It's a bit late to be booking such a long stay. The Empire Hotel is modern and trendy and running a special on   travelzoo.com  for $239/night plus tax. That will buy a standard queen room which is not terribly large but it's a good location. Reviews on the hotel are mixed. Keep in mind taxes will add ~ 15% to that price to bring it to $275.    You might want to consider splitting your stay between 2 hotels in 2 different areas which may give you more options since a lot of hotels aren't available for your whole stay. The Hampton Inn Seaport while not terribly central is a good hotel that's relatively modern, has some views and includes a free continental breakfast. It's ~$200-220/night plus tax depending on what room you pick and whether you prepay. You could also consider staying just outside Manhattan a train ride away. The Westin Jersey City and the W Hobo
ken are both new and very modern offering some views."
0,"Thanks everyone.    The idea about splitting the trip is a good one.    We'll investigate what that brings up today.    I'm coming over for work (i work in museums here in mel :) so need to be on manhattan to go to the course easily enough.     Cheers,    e"
2,"Three in a room for $200/250 at that time of year is going to be a challenge....you know that, right?  Have you looked to your left on this forum - like I'm doing right now and seeing a listing for Discount Hotels - give that a shot - or try one of my regular places The Hotel Stanford on 32nd Street - they have rooms that will not break the bank - not sure about that time of year though, everyone jacks up the prices...."
2,"On your dates, quikbook.com is showing a rate of $199 for 4 with a room with 2 queen beds. I would grab this ASAP as that's an excellent rate for that time and you'll be hard pressed to find something better. Rooms with 2 queen beds aren't all that common. That rate won't last long either. With quikbook, rates are usually fully cancelable up until one or two days before arrival. This hotel is located at South Street Seaport, nearly all the way downtown."
2,"As I read it it's 4 to the room and those dates are a good time to find some hotel bargains so you really have a lot of choices. The Best Western Seaport is $199/night plus tax for 2 queen beds on quikbook.com They also include cont. b/f I think. The Hampton Inn Chelsea is a more convenient location at that time of year and is $212/night plus tax for 2 queen beds. The Best Western Hanbee is also well within your budget for 2 queen beds and free cont. b/f.     If you want to be more centrally located and can put up with 2 double beds instead of queens, the Belvedere has 2 doubles (I saw it on hotels.com but it may be elsewhere) and the trendy Empire Hotel has 2 doubles on hotels for $197/night. Tax adds ~ 15% to prices."
0,Some of the pricing I got was from  kayak.com  The Empire price was on hotels.com
2,"Also try Hotel 414. Newly renovated, free continental breakfast, modern feel (not old and stodgy), very reasonable and in a great neighbourhood - Restaurant Row!"
0,thank you all very much! im checking into those you listed now! we were looking for a location that is about midtown so that if its could we could easily go put our shopping bags in our room. Are any that you listed in midtown or conveniently located?
0,also what do u think about the park central hotel
2,"It's very easy and very clearly marked. There are 3-4 bus ramps at the ferry terminal, with signs for which buses are at which ramp. Once outside, there are posts with the bus numbers on them. Do tell the driver you want to get off at Snug Harbor.    You need to cross the road for the entrance. There's a bus stop right in front. Take a look at the schedule before you go in, and note what times the buses leave to return to the ferry terminal.    Or, take a walk down the road a piece and have lunch at -- I'm not 100% sure of the name but it's something like Tugs. It's just a few minutes' walk in the same direction as the bus you just got off. On the water side. It's an industrial setting, but clean, and you get to see lots and lots of cute tug boats going by. (I'm a sucker for tug boats!) Good burgers too.    The Chinese Scholar's Garden at Snug Harbor is amazing!"
1,"Ink - If we wanted to (or had to) the walk from Snug back to the terminal isn't too taxing?    Also, I'm assuming a Metrocard for the bus, it's Staten Island, but still NYC :-)"
1,"I wouldn't walk it. It's farther than you think. If I recall, it was about 15 minutes on the bus. And not an interesting walk either.    Yes, same metrocard for the bus.    Oh, and here's the link for Tugs:  http://www.rhtugs.com/default.aspx?pageId=1"
1,"Totally concur with what Ink just said - it's easy and all very well signed.     I recently visited the Chinese Scholar Garden and it's a lovely setting. I now want to visit it in all 4 seasons, as I think it would be delightful covered in snow, or in fall colours, or in spring with the trees blossoming. No matter what time of year, it's worth a visit."
1,"I have walked it, and I concur: it really is too far to walk comfortably; I would not do it again, but would wait for the bus."
0,"Thanks everyone.    But just out of curiosity, do I still have to be in the first five cars for the South Ferry stop?"
0,"No, you don't."
2,"To expand on that: the South Ferry station used to be a loop, and because of the sharp bend could not be extended the way most of the other old IRT stations were. As a result, only the number of cars that were in the original IRT consists could fit in the station -- so that mean the first five. Recently South Ferry station was entirely rebuilt. It is no longer a loop, but is instead a stub-end terminal: the trains end at a blank wall, and reverse direction when they leave, with the motorman walking from one end of the train to the other, as you would see him do at, say, Times Square on the #7, or New Lots Avenue. As a brand-new station, it was built with straight platforms long enough to accommodate all of a modern train. In addition, the new South Ferry station is connected with Whitehall Street (the old one wasn't), and you can now transfer from the 1 to the R."
2,"Try the Knicks website or the MSG website - either should direct you to ticketmaster, where you can buy your ticket online and collect at the will call window on the day of the game. The site also has a seating plan of the Garden. Anything in the 300s and below are generally cosidered to be good seats.    I've gone through this process a couple of times and had no problems - as long as ou remember to take the card you use to bok the tickets when you pick them up.    Simples"

1,"Im going to NYC April 2010 and we just bought our Knicks tickets, for the Celtics game! We got ours off ticketmaster, and they were about $80 for centre court 3 tiers back, which Im told arent too shabby."
1,Also try Stubhub.com that's where I bought our tix for Jan.
2,Yes we were part of the audience in Febuary 2009.I advise you to get there early.Yes it is worth the time. We had a lot of fun but to get inside you do need to get there early. The pass does not guarantee entry into the show.It is what time you get there.Good luck but you should have no problem if you are not going during a school vacation.
1,I think all of those shows are better in the planning than in the doing... They are really made for TV and depending on where you sit all you may end up seeing is the backs of a lot of people running around doing their job..
1,"irisblue... From what the pass says, we'll have to stand for the two hours? Also, did you get any pics with the hosts?"
1,what about the outdoor spot on GMA-- is there any way to check out a daily calendar for music guest appearancs? Anyone guess by what time people need to show up to get spots close to the front of the gated area?
2,"irisblue55 is correct... you may have passes but they don't guarantee you access inside unless you get there early enough. While I have never been to see GMA, I work for ABC News and colleagues have said the same thing.    I highly suggest going especially if you haven't seen a live tv broadcast in person. You may be surprised on the size of the studio and other things.    Have fun."
1,whoops-- mental block-- now doubting if I know my morning network programs-- is the outdoor entertainment spot on the Today show or GMA??
1,beachbum... Thank you for your advice. That helps a great deal!    I believe both shows have outside audiences.
0,No doubt though the one you are referring to is the Today show.
1,"thanks for clarifying, bilmin. Still, FYI-- For those interested in The Today Show concert series, looks like you need fan passes that you can get by email after signing up online at     http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29181613     and that, even with passes, it's first come, first served with visitors arriving as early as 6 a.m. for shows beginning at 8, 9 or 10 a.m. Schedule is posted there but only a few days in advance."
1,CPAandMom...just wondering how long ago you requested tickets? I requested tickets for GMA about a month ago and have yet to receive any. We are going to NYC Oct 6th!
1,"Probably in less than two weeks, I had a reply. They sent me an e-mail in which I was to confirm the date and number of people. According to their e-mail, September is traditionally a good month to be admitted."
1,Yes you stand the whole time and yes we did get pictures.We really enjoyed the show because we have been watching this show for a long time.
2,"Absolutely and completely worth our time! Harrison Ford, Clive Owen, and Melissa (from Bachelor and Dancing with the Stars fame) were there. Robin Roberts was great... chatting it up with the indoor studio audience.    Everyone with their confirmed e-mail got in. Some, but not all, of the ones with the confirmation got in as well. The ones who did not get in stood outside and peered in.     The indoor studio audience got their group pictures taken with Robin and Diane."
1,"I meant... some, but not all, of those withOUT their confirmation got in."
1,"You will surely have to call a cab. I'm pretty sure they don't cruise in Yonkers and wouldn't count on it anyway. If you are going to visit a friend, ask the friend for some info. If you are going to a particular venue, I'd call the venue and ask for some details re cabs etc."
1,Take the train.     www.njtransit.com  www.visitnj.org
0,can we get a taxi for $60.00 or less? there will be 3 of us and a shuttle will cost $21.00 each. I guess a taxi would be faster?
1,Taxi is prone to Traffic. The shuttle from what I hear is a verry bad idea.
1,if we take the train from Newark to the Port Authority Terminal would that put us near the Sheraton Towers in Times Square?
1,I beleve. I thin the train dosn't goto the Port Autharaty.
2,"The Sheraton is at 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue. All trains go to Penn Station. This is what you should do:    1) Take the AirTrain to the Newark Liberty train station.    2) Take the New Jersey Transit train to New York (NOT Newark!!!!!!!!!!) Penn Station.    3) Take the uptown E (Not the C! Not the A! Not ANYTHING going "";downtown"";!!!!) subway train from Penn Station -- that is, the Eighth Avenue/34th Street stop -- to the Seventh Avenue station. Exit at the Seventh Avenue exit and you will be at your hotel."
0,"wow, you guys are a wealth of info, I have used this site ti plan trips in the past but you guys are fast and give detailed info.    THANKS SO MUCH!"
0,"How long does it take from newark to penn station? we have a 6 hour layover in newark, and we were thinking of taking the train in, and getting a bit to eat."
1,Ferom the airport to Penn 1 stop 3 minute but it is $7. The 62 bus is a$1.35 excact change and maybe 10 miutes. Here is alink    www.njtransit.com  www.goironbound.com
2,"I think that what the people from Portland Oregon are asking is how long it takes from Newark Airport to New York Penn Station using AirTrain Newark / NJ Transit.    The answer is that it depends somewhat on day of the week and time of day. Weekdays from 5:00AM to 9:00PM the trains are very very frequent and very fast. After about 9:00PM there aren't as many trains from Newark to New York Penn (roughly two to three an hour after 9:00PM). From New York Penn to Newark on weeknights the trains are more frequent. On weekends there are at least three trains an hour until the middle of the evening. The train schedule is easy to find on www.njtransit.com (select Newark Airport as origin and New York Penn as destination - or vice versa).    It can take as little as 40 - 45 minutes from Terminal C to New York Penn however I like to tell people to allow a full hour.    The shuttles are a really really terrible idea. They're such a nightmare. Terrible. Dreadful. Avoid the shuttles.    People seem 
to have alot of complaints about Newark cabs. Drivers hold your bags hostage as they demand more money for tolls. It has never happened to me but I've read the stories on here.    Prearranging a car service is a good idea but it is such a pain with all the traffic getting into Manhattan. I've spent more than an hour sitting at the tunnel waiting. The train can take less than 45 minutes while it can take an hour and a half in a car (without a restroom and unable to stretch your legs). The trains are easy to use, well-marked, very safe and comfortable. The trains have restrooms, plenty of room to stretch your legs. Tickets are $15.00 per person (each way), buy your tickets using a credit card. I'm a big fan of AirTrain Newark / NJ Transit."
0,My Bad. Didn't see the from. But I would still reccomend checking out the Ironbound.
1,"Hi Lassie !!! Why not, unless there are other events going on in NYC that you rather go to.    www.atlanticave.org/antic2009/antic2009.htm"
2,Yes it is worth visiting- It runs along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Is easy to get to via subway... Any subway line that takes you to Borough Hall or Court Street in Brooklyn gets you within 5 blocks of Atlantic Ave... there are a few entertainment stages and lots of ethnically diverse booths with lots of great food.    There would be little mention of it because there are decent street fairs almost every week this time of year. Many tourists think that the only thing in Brooklyn is one end of a bridge and a pizza place named Grimaldi's. You have however found one of the better street fairs in all of the city. Come on over to Brooklyn and while you are there check out the Transit museum which is only 2 blocks away.
0,"Thanks, UrbanNYC - Yes, I've already looked at their website, was just wondering what people thought of it. Because it hadn't come up on the forum, I thought it mightn't be worth the effort. We're only in New York for one week, but did want to see Brooklyn and walk the B Bridge. We were thinking of catching the subway to Atlantic Ave and wondering back down through the Antic to Brooklyn Heights and with the help of the Idiot's Guide to Brooklyn, cross the bridge back to Manhatten at sunset. This also raises the question - Will everyone else have the same idea, ie Will the Bridge be backed at that time on that day?"
0,"Thanks, Bilmin, that's reassuring. Please forgive my typo in above post. I meant to say, will the bridge be packed - ie very busy!"
2,The bridge is always busiest on a Sunday but the walkway is wide enough to accommodate the crowds.. Your plan to go to Atlantic and then walk back towards Brooklyn Heights will work too or you can do it the other way as I suggested. I live in Brooklyn Heights and there is lots to see there too. I would eventually make your way to Montague street where there are shops and restaurants and the street is about 5 blocks long leading to the Brooklyn Promenade which you should see for a great view of Manhattan and make sure to bring your camera.

1,"It looks like it might be more of a restaurant than just a "";take-away""; cupcake place. Anyone been there who knows for sure?"
1,I took a client and his family to 'Kyotofu' last year for after diner desert. The place is kind of small and it was loaded with young Japanese. I remember there was a line to get in. The deserts are cute and ..... ah ..... different. We were a group of 8 and got a table in the back room. I think there was also food on the menu but mainly it's desert place with different kinds of drinks. Can't recall cupcakes ..... I thought it was a lot of artsy Japanese looking stuff ..... with weird textures and odd taste.
0,"Thanks, Lotus! I read that theirs were voted "";best cupcake""; by New York magazine, and I was going to add them to my list of places to try cupcakes when I'm there. I think I'll cross them off the list, because I don't really want to have to wait to be seated - just want to get a cupcake and go!"
2,"NYCforMe---Last time we were in NYC we had a very small TA gathering there. Yes, it's a sit-down place---and popular, too. They have both food and drinks on the menu."
2,"Kyotofu offers both sitdown and take-out. There is a very cool looking dining room in the back, and they have a great selection of sake, cocktails, tea, wine, champagne. Or, you can just get a cupcake to go from their bakery."
0,"Thanks,cupcakenyc. Just what I wanted to know! I'll add them back to my list."
1,All food can be either good or bad---- what kind of food are you looking for and what is your per person budget.
2,"Don't know about their Christmas decorations, but both the River Cafe and the Boathouse in Central Park are among the loveliest places for a special lunch in NYC.    The River Cafe has spectacular views of Manhattan and the Boathouse looks out on a serene lake in Central Park.     Happy Anniversary/Birthday !"
2,I think you should have lunch somewhere else as the food is not great.   But for the rest of i there is this little Indian place called Rose of India that every body who comes in says it is their birthday because they do a hilarious Happy Birthday song to anyone who says it is their birthday and you get a free dessert. It has cheesy Christmas decorations year round. You will have a REAL NY experience.   I do not know about Christmas decorations because there are so many religions and cultures here most restaurant owners do not want to alienate anyone who is of another faith. I second the River Cafe in Brooklyn but do not know if they have decorations for Christmas. You could go there for lunch and for fun go to Rose of India for dessert.   There s aalso Rolff's but the food is not great.  http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/rolfs/

0,Thanks everyone.
1,its worth using a couple and seeing which is best such as :-    www.expedia.com  www.priceline.com  www.quikbook.com    and    www.kayak.com for flights
2,"There's never a simple answer to this. Some hotels may have better prices or better availability on third party websites. For example, you can sometimes find sale prices on the Affinia.com hotels on quikbook.com or hotels.com that are better than the hotels' own websites. Travelzoo.com historically has had some specials for Affinia hotels and there's usually nothing better than a travelzoo or travel-ticker.com sale.    Some hotels like the Beaconhotel.com don't discount on 3rd party websites. So in your shoes I'd book something cancelable now for the April trip and keep an eye out for specials on these other websites. Are you trying to sleep 4 adults in one suite? If yes and if it's 2 couples and you want a 2 bedroom apartment, your options for that are pricier and somewhat limited so post back. Very often 2 studio suites is cheaper than one 2 bedroom suite."
2,"Thank you so much for your help. Yes, it's 2 couples and actually we don't mind sharing the same bedroom as long as the beds are double or queen size--we are older couples (related) and travel with each other a lot. I certainly will check out the sites you both mentioned and will take your advice about booking a hotel while keeping my eyes open for specials. Do you advocate signing up for e-mails from the hotel sites? Once again thank you."
2,We signed up for hotel email deals which have been really useful. But we've also cross - checked each deal with third party sites. The AAA discounts with some hotels have been really good also. And the free loyalty programmes have added some uselful little extras so make sure you join these.
1,"Thank you for your help also, I guess I had better plan on some computer time while waiting for our New York trip !!"
2,2 queen beds provide a lot more comfort than doubles. The Affinia 50 has 1 bedroom suites with 2 queens.  affinia.com/New-York-City-Hotel.aspx  as does the Lucerne  www.thelucernehotel.com/default.aspx
1,"Web site, Bedandbreakfast.com also have apt's. Then you can have a full kitchen to use. They can also email specials."
0,"are the ones on that site leagl though? I suspect some, most or all wont be!"
1,Thank you all for the information--this site has been a valuable tool for planning our trip--I will probably have lots more questions in the coming days and it is comforting to know there are truely good people here who try to help other people with information and advice. THANK YOU .
2,"While I have not booked through Bedandbreakfast.com, I researched them as an option. They are still on my list. There is nothing illegal about this. Why would you say that unless you have specific information? I would research the individual property since they are privately owned. If particularly concerned... the Better Business Bureau. It's always good to cross reference everything."
1,"Lots of options, but I've always found best rates by calling the hotel direct."
1,"Once you find a good rate at the aggregators, go to the hotel's site as it might be cheaper. If not, email the hotel and ask them to match the rate. Most of the time they will, and now you have a cancellable reservation booked directly with the hotel without a 3rd party. This is great in case something goes wrong."
1,Excellent advice--thank you
2,Take a NYC yellow cab which will have a line right outside of the terminal.
2,"I would recommend booking a car service with a fixed price. Alexa transportation is a co. based in Staten Island and all the drivers are ex police or firemen. They're very reliable and will be more likely to know their way around Staten Island.  limos.com/operators/alexa-transportation-cor  If your Aunt is also arriving at LGA only a half hr. later, your sister might want to wait at the airport for her so they can travel together. If they don't travel together, I assume someone else will be at the house should your sister arrive before your Aunt?"
2,"I agree that a car service is the way to go. While Yellow Cab drivers are legally obliged to take passengers anywhere in the 5 boroughs, there's no law that says they need to know their way around Staten Island, which is about twice as large as Manhattan. Unless your sister can give the driver street-by-street directions, things could get very expensive...and as the driver's not likely be able to pick up a return fare on SI, the temptation to "";take the scenic route""; *might* be a factor."
0,"Thanks guys for all your advice! We thought about the cab idea, but that idea scared us because they might take us the "";scenic route""; lol. AND my sister's only been to my Aunt's house couple times so she's really not familiar with the whole area.    Something with a fixed price is what we're leaning more towards...and not too pricey pls =)    How about Shuttles?     Yah, my aunt can't miss her meeting unfortunately. Is traffic bad during that time?     Thank you so much again!! =)"
1,definitely not shuttles they are not a good idea in NY    If you want a fixed price then a car service might do - www.dial7.com for example.
0,wow fast reply! Thank you! =) I'll check it out now =)    Have good day!
2,"I recommend Dial7 all the time but for this trip to Staten Island, I highly recommend using Alexa instead since they're based in SI and will know the area well. If you decide to us Dial7, make sure you have printed directions to the final destination in case the driver has a problem."
0,Oh. alright will do that. That's good to know =)     Thanks nywhiz =)
1,""";Thanks guys for all your advice! We thought about the cab idea, but that idea scared us because they might take us the 'scenic route' lol."";     You don't have any reason to fear this. It's in a cab driver's best interest to get you in and out as soon as possible."
1,I wouldnt bother doing the ESB if I was you - TOTR is much better.    What other attractions do you have in mind?
2,"The Statue of Liberty, if you plan on going to the statue itself or to Ellis Island (as opposed to taking a boat past):  http://www.statuecruises.com/  Also, we prefer to book shows and plays in advance rather than trying for the same-day tickets, as that allows us to avoid wasting time in line. If that sounds appealing to you, have a look at   http://www.broadwaybox.com/"
1,planning on ferry that goes past SOL.   ESB  carriage round central park  broadway show.  Not sure what else there is that involves booking hence why I need some input from people who knows    thanks for your help so far. x
2,"I agree w/Crans - pre-book any Broadway shows and as for outdoor attractions, SOL/TOTR/ESB I would wait until I was in the City - make sure it's a clear day - no use going up that high with a cloud cover.    Welcome back, Crans' - Poppa"
2,"You can't book the Staten Island Ferry, just show up.  Also, you cannot book a carriage ride - however why would you want to approx $50.00 for a 10/15 minute ride - even though it is supposed to be longer - the horses are not in good shape at all and treated very poorly, I'd give this a skip. Maybe a rickshaw ride would serve you better.  Poppa"
1,NO need to book Staten Island Ferry (if indeed you actually can book it)
0,ok thanks for info on carriage - what is the saw ride you mentioned?
0,I mean rickshaw ride!
1,"rickshaw - a two-wheeled vehicle pulled by a person, usually a male - has roots in the Asian culture...    A regular poster here, TourGuideStan, is a rickshaw owner and often gives advice to tourists...hopefully he'll jump in to give you some background on this mode of touring CP.....    Poppa"
2,Stan's pedicab tours are AWESOME
2,"I would also suggest the New York Party Shuttle tours, which is what we did on our first day. The tour we choose lasted about 5 hours, but you get to see most of the Tourist sight including a trip on the Staten Island Ferry, passing the Satue of Liberty, and too many to mention, check their web site for full details. You are escorted by knowledgeable guides throughout, its fun and the time flies past. This can be book in advance.    We also did the pedicab tour of Central Park which was fantastic and such a laugh, but also very informative, history and film locations etc.    You will have a ball, I am returning in Nov. Once you have been you will be hooked!!!!x"
1,"Sorry to hi-jack this thread, but I am paying my first visit to New York on this Wednesday.  I am thinking of booking a show before we go, and just wanted to say thank you to Crans for posting the link to BroadwayBox. I had never heard of it and the discounts are brilliant.  Thanks again."
1,"Well, I have returned from my week in New York City and absolutely loved it.  Thanks again to Crans for the BroadwayBox.com website.  I printed off a voucher for Phantom of the Opera and brought it to the theatre the night we arrived. Got wonderful orchestra seats for the following night for half price. We were absolutely delighted and no need to queue at the TKTS office."
2,"Allthough Top of the rock is better, If its your first time to NYC, you should do ESB also. Book a priority pass, worth every penny as it can be used when you wan't to go up, and you skip all the lines except the security line. Brilliant"
2,""";I just wondered if there would be a problem taking my two teenage children there"";    What kind of problem are you talking about? Do they have an age minimum for that night?"
1,As long as you go to a restaurant and not an outright bar you should have no problem with teens. That location is probably 15-20 minute walk from the center of the park where you need to get to see the Fireworks.
2,"Yes, age of the children, (16 and 18).    15-20 minutes to the park should be okay, would I still be able to get back in to the restaurant after the fireworks?"
2,">>would I still be able to get back in to the restaurant after the fireworks?>>  Not sure what this means. Are you thinking of eating, leaving for the fireworks, then going back to the restaurant? That's not going to happen. If the restaurant is even still open, they're not going to hold your table for an hour while you go over to wait for the fireworks.  Is that what you're asking about? Or do you mean something else?"
2,Yes I was kind of hoping that we would be able to get back in for a drink before heading back to the hotel.  It's not essential just a thought!
2,As for going back to the restaurant. It will depend on what the rest of the crowd does... In some places shortly after 12:30 or 1am people start clearing out because they have been there all night.... in other places the party is just getting started at Midnight and will be going all night....If there is room I am sure you can work out a deal to come back in but you very well may not have the same table. You probably would not be back until about 1:15am. You will need to fight your way back through the crowd and back to the restaurant.
0,Thanks for the information. Would another restaurant be a better option? Or is Rosa a good choice?
1,"Other than Rosa Mexicana, can I get a restaurant that will have some music, either back ground or live music."
1,"What do you consider "";not too much"";? This is an expensive time of year."
1,"The important thing to know is that you do not really need to be "";near""; the Javitts Center you just need to know how to get there by public transportation. This will open up a whole lot for you once you tell us what your budget is."
2,"there will be Javits Center buses (free for show attendees) coming from Penn Station, Grand Central, and other locations.....you should check this because it will allow you to stay in other locations (way west 42nd to 34th Street is not the greatest location in the evenings)....i would also check with their discount hotel list...i know when the Gift Show is on, there are a number of hotels that participate with very special rates"
1,"Thanks for all the info. I am looking to spend no more than $300/night but if i can get anything better that that it would be great. I live in Costa Rica and is just my second time in New York. Actually I am attending the Expo on the Javitz Center to promote our vacation rentals properties in Tamarindo, Costa Rica, so we reserved a booth for our company.    The Expo is only Oct 10-11 and the rest of the time is for appointment with travel agencies, so i don't really need to be around teh Javitz Center the entire time. I have a fried in Brooklyn so I may stay in his place for a couple of nights after the expo, so i am looking forward to get a hotel room on Thursday evening (flight arrives at 9:55 pm JFK), then Friday head to the Javitz for all the prep work in the booth and then stay in the same place for the following two nights Sat-Sun and then after that maybe stay with my friend.     Thanks for the help."
2,That weekend is a holiday weekend here with banks and schools closed on the Monday. That plus the travel expo is pushing prices very high. The area immediately around the Javits Center doesn't have a lot to offer. The best option I see that's cancelable is the Shelburne Murray Hill for just under $300/night PLUS tax (15%) on hotels.com    The Travel Inn is a decent budget hotel and is $213/night plus tax on booking.com    The Hampton Inn Times Square South at 337 West 39th Street is very close to the Javits Center and has a prepay rate that's not cancelable of $264 plus tax.
2,"New Rochelle is on the New Haven line of the Metro-North Railroad:  http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm  (It's the red line.)  You can take a bus from JFK to Grand Central Station, where you can board the Metro-North train:  www.nyairportservice.com/page.php?id=48"
1,What are you going to do when you get to New Rochelle. Since it is not in the city you will need transportation of some sort to get around. In that case you may want to rent a car at Jfk and drive. The one day cost would be equal to the taxi fare and you will be in control.
1,"I will be attending a wedding in New Rochelle.     When I take the Metro-North to New Rochelle, would it be easy for me to come out of the station and get a taxi to a hotel?"
1,You might have to call one.  Blue Bird Taxi - 914-632-0909
1,"And is the wedding in the hotel or do you need to plan how to get there. Public transportation is fine in a big city but limited outside of the city. You need to think through the entire time there to determine your best way of getting around. You may contact the hotel, sometimes they have the info on the best way to get directly there from airports."
1,How much would the taxi charge from the station to the Marriott Residence Inn? I really appreciate the responses guys :-)
1,its quite close maybe 8 minutes max so proabbly not much less
2,"Your combined cost of getting from JFK to New Rochelle and back to JFK -- using the Airport Express Service bus and MetroNorth -- will be $40-45 round-trip, depending on whether you'll riding the MetroNorth train at times it deems to be peak or off-peak.    The New Rochelle train station is only 1/2 mile from the Residence Inn, and according to MetroNorth's page re: the New Rochelle station, Bluebird Taxi has its office right at the train station. Sounds easy peasy :-)  as0.mta.info/mnr/stations/station_detail.cfm"
1,"One more thing, would I have to be going up and down a lot of stairs? I was thinking about my luggage..."
2,Not a major problem here but I would still take the shot if you have the chance
2,"No real flu issues here in City - yet, but if you have the opportunity to get the Swine Flu shot, I would do it. Ive already gotten my regular flu shot, just waiting for the SW shot to become available."
2,"The media report that up to half our population will likely be infected. While that sounds frightening, regular seasonal flu kills far more people. The curious thing about the swine flu seems to be that young people are more susceptible than old, which is the opposite of seasonal flu.     Anyway, if you can get vaccinated, it's a good idea. We're a little late here, our swine flu vaccines won't be available for another few weeks."
0,"thanks for the info,think il take the jab,don t want anything interfering with my trip"
2,"Not based on any medical background, just personal opinion, I'd just say if you plan to take the shot, take it sooner rather than later...as far from your travel time as possible just in case the shot itself gives you any ill effects. It's miserable to be sick while traveling.     I got an email the other day on ways to reduce chances of getting the flu and think it's worth posting here:    "";1. Frequent hand-washing (well highlighted in all official communications).     2. "";Hands-off-the-face""; approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face (unless you want to eat, bathe or slap).     3. Gargle twice a day with warm salt water (use Listerine if you don't trust salt). *H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat/ nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms. Simple gargling prevents proliferation. In a way, gargling with salt water has the same effect on a healthy individual that Tamiflu has on an infected one. Don't und
erestimate this simple, inexpensive and powerful preventative method.     4. Similar to 3 above, clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water.     Not everybody may be good at JalaNeti or Sutra Neti (very good Yoga asanas to clean nasal cavities), but blowing the nose hard once a day and swabbing both nostrils with cotton buds dipped in warm salt water is very effective in bringing down viral population.    5. Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C (Amla and other citrus fruits). If you have to supplement with Vitamin C tablets, make sure that it also has Zinc to boost absorption.    6. Drink warm liquids as much as you can. Drinking warm liquids has the same effect as gargling, but in the reverse direction.     They wash off proliferating viruses from the throat into the stomach where they cannot survive, proliferate or do any harm.    All these are simple ways to prevent, within means of most households, and certainly much less painful than to wait in long queu
es outside public hospitals."";"
0,"sounds like good advise nywhiz,going to get the shot this week or next"
1,Benji--- just a warning. There are reports that the Swine flu shots make you allergic to any beer consumed for the next 30 days. so keep that in mind when considering your shot ! I'm sure you were not considering drinking anyway right ?
0,"Does anyone know if you have to fill in a health declearation form before entering US? I know turkey, Malta etc make you.    Or do you have to go through a machine that does thermal imaging etc?  thanks"
2,Yes I have eaten at Becco as well as a number of places on 46th street. It was the hot place last summer but while you might be coming from a matinee that will be prime time for those going to an evening performance and if you can you would be better off doing something else for an hour and making your reservation for 8pm after the theater crowd has cleared out..
2,"If you hit them on a good night, the pasta can be excellent (lobster risotto a standout). Some nights it's fairly ordinary though. And since they expanded their space a few years ago, the tables are packed very tightly together. Still a good choice of inexpensive bottles of wine."
2,"Becco (becconyc.com) is a personal favorite and famous for its Sinfonia di Pasta. Food and service is always outstanding here. The restaurant is always busy, but especially so at pretheatre dining hours, so 7:pm on a Saturday will be particularly busy. I would suggest making a reservation for 8:pm when things will have calmed down a bit. Along with the pasta special, we especially enjoy the ossobuco. We always find this place to be an exceptional value, particularly noting the extensive wine list at #25 per bottle. Also notable are the ossobuco and the dessert sampler of excellent in house made desserts."
1,"I was hedging on the 7 PM rezzie, my wife wanted to eat early - but it will be no problem to change to 8 as we are staying only a couple of blocks away on 46th. And another cocktail is always a good thing.  Thanks all for your responses.    Poppa"
0,What are you and Mrs. Poppa coming into the city to see? Where are you staying this time? Sounds like a great little getaway.
2,"I agree with all of the above. I've eaten there several times - always before a show - so it's always been packed and LOUD. However, the food has always been great and the wine selection pretty good -and not unreasonable by any means. Have a great time Poppa."
0,"Staying at the Hotel at Times Square and seeing West Side Story, if I get off nmy duff and order the tickets.  Heading in on Friday for the Photo Expo at the Javits and Gramma is coming down on Saturday for the show and dinner, etc....leaving Sunday after lunch.  Poppa"
0,Perfect. Have a good time.
0,I know you are a Broadway Box advocate and I assume you are getting your tickets there.... we saw it a week ago or so and enjoyed it despite some strange directorial choices... Tony was much weaker than Maria and Anita was the best thing in the show. I won't spoil it by telling you the details but enjoy the show.
0,"Yes broadwaybox.com for one ticket - the other is from a gift certificate whose site shows the same seat for a bit more money, at least it's not coming out of my pocket.  Thanks to all for the responses.  Poppa"
1,"i tried their 3 pasta special, all you can eat  not impressed  won't be going back there  the food was average  maybe their a la carte is better but you can get a better meal for less IMO"
1,"There are not competing taxi companies in New York City--all taxis are official, city-regulated yellow cabs. You step into the street and hail one. More info here:  tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s304/New-York-Don't know about Newark, sorry."
2,"As Crans noted, you do not have competing taxi companies in NYC. To make even more explicit what she said, you cannot telephone for a taxicab in New York City. The ONLY ways to get a taxicab are to find one at a taxi stand (such as at the airport, or in front of a train station), or to hail one on the street. When that hailed taxi pulls up in front of you, you will not be able to tell by looking at it who owns it (whether a taxi company, or the driver who is behind the wheel, or whoever) as all taxicabs in NYC are painted the same color (yellow) with the same markings as approved by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. If you want to call a company for a car that will then be dispatched to you from a central location, that vehicle is not a taxicab, but is instead a limo or a livery car."
1,"Thanks for the NYC info...I don't forsee any problem finding a taxi in Manhattan then.    So what about over in Harrison, NJ / Newark / NJ?"
1,Whether you can find a cab in Manhattan depends on time of day and where in Manhattan you are. Sometimes it's easy. Some places it's impossible.
1,Newark cabs are all the same design like NYC cabs are however the owners name is on the rear doors.
1,"The best "";taxi""; in Manhattan is known as the subway. Unless there is some physical reason you cannot take the subway (can't navigate steps) using a taxi as your mode of transport in Manhattan is a waste. A waste of money, but also in many cases a waste of time as the subway is running under the city and does not have to deal with bumper to bumper traffic that taxis often have to."
1,"I plan on using the subway for most of my transportaion, yes. Walking is my 2nd choice. Taxi is last resort or late night backup if needed. I rarely use taxis, but sometimes they are nice for those spur-of-the-moment short trips. I haven't visited a large city yet that I didn't use the public transportation except in Caracas, Venezuela. But then again, I immediately headed out to the country with my rental car after spending the night there. I've used public transport in Cleveland here (the "";rapid""; trains and buses), Toronto, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Diego, Tijuana, Pittsburgh, Boston, Honduras, Guatemala (quite interesting), Brazil, and Spain.     Despite all that, my kids like the subway too..."
2,"You should not choose a taxi because of the hour. The subway is safer at 3 in the morning than it is at 3 in the afternoon, largely because a vastly disproportionate amount of the very, very little subway crime that does exist is committed by high school kids picking on each other. When the little darlings head home around 8 or 9 in the evening, crime in the subway involving personal confrontations largely disappears. With an average of one robbery for every 4 and a half million passengers, you have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than of being robbed on the subway in NYC."
1,"I'm not too concerned with the time of day that we ride, but thanks for the reassurance!"
1,$400 cheaper at the Pierre---- go for it although I have not heard anything one way or the other about the recent renovations... but i don't think you will be disappointed with the Pierre--- it's not like you are comparing the Palace with hotel 99.
1,the original rooms at the Pierre were quite large...cannot imagine that they made them smaller during the renovation so go with the Pierre definitely....city views make it all the better
1,"I'm stumped by your description. The Pierre has no Executive King rooms; there are Executive King suites which are 700 square feet in area, so certainly not "";really small."";    If you don't hold a reservation for an Executive King suite (or aren't certain that's what you've got), give the Pierre a ring and ask about the square footage of the room they're holding for you."
0,"Oops, I have a City view King at the Pierre and an Executve level Corner King at the Palace. Just do not wan to be disappointed at the Pierre with a cramped room...we only get to NYC every year and a half or so so I like it to be good. The Pierre was 3 nights for the price of 2 so maybe I should take what could be my only opportunity to stay there and do it."
1,"That should be 300-320 sq. ft, but didn't you say previously that you're getting a free upgrade at the Pierre? Really, the most reliable source of information as to what you can expect is going to be the hotel itself; is there some reason you're hesitant to call them?"
0,"No, I will call. Just wanted to know if anyone had stayed there recently and what they thought."
2,"I understand, but without knowing what you might/will be upgraded to, we'd be engaging in sheer speculation as to the size of the room you'll get there. Plus, most of us don't actually measure our hotel rooms while in them, and in the absence of measurements, you can't be certain that someone else's sense of "";large""; squares with your definition of that.    Don't be shy about letting the Pierre know that you're calling because you're trying to decide between it and the Palace. Knowing that the room size is your concern may prompt them to bump you to a larger room than might otherwise be the case."
0,Very helplful. Thanks. I get an upgrade through AmEx if available but I always have when I have done this. It upgrades to a Park View for free but I could cough up some more cash for a suite but doubt I would. Years ago I said I would stay at the Pierre if I could after they treated my baby and I so well one time that we went in for some tea and a break (unlike the Plaza). Think I will do the Pierre. Thanks.
0,"YAY, hope you'll post back with a trip report -- or write a review of the Pierre for TA -- so we can hear all about it :-)     Have a great weekend!"
0,"Thanks. Also have ticket to A Steady Rain with Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman. Will review it all! Rain, rain ,go away..."
2,depends on what kind of food you want but it does not have to be near the Garden... I would look on 9th avenue around 50th street there are tons of places from the 40's to the 60's on 9th.... from there when done go to 50th and 8th avenue and catch the A-C subway to 34th street and you will be inside of MSG.
0,"BTW .... I have to say I was surprised when I first learned that Keith ..... a 'country music' singer ..... is Australian.

0,How was the show???
0,The show was awesome!!! Keith was just so great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I don't know when it starts but you might check out Bryant Park which sets up a little village every year about that time along with an ice rink.
2,Some will be open. You can see the dates for last year here:  nymag.com/guides/holidays/holidayshopping/  I have no reason to believe they'll be significantly different in 2009.
2,"They are all really nice and generally have the same type of merchandise. If the weather cooperates check out both the Union Square and Bryant Park markets.    The Grand Central market is indoors, and the whole terminal is worth a visit and a look around, with nice places to eat on the lower lever."
1,thanks for this...i have been at xmas before and love bryants park so very excited to see that it should be open!!
2,"In the nearly 10 years I've lived in NYC, the Union Square Holiday Market has always opened the day after Thanksgiving and closed on Xmas Eve. Safe to assume it will be the same this year.    Walking around the stalls is one of my new favorite holiday traditions. Even though a lot of the booths are the same year to year, there is something so comforting and enjoyable about strolling through the packed aisles on a chilly evening.    I hope you enjoy it!"

1,thanks so much for this. I have written them all into our itinerary!!
2,Mid week (tues-wed) is always less crowded for things NYC based... 1. people tend to come for long weekends and then depart (thurs-Monday) 2. the local working stiffs like me are working and not going to shows. The Radio City Music Hall shows have extensive schedules and their tickets are always being offered somewhere at substantial discounts for the shows not doing well (like 2 for 1) so keep an eye out for that and review the schedule first to see what your options are but don't buy too early and don't pay full price..
2,"Well, as a fellow tourist, I must say that I probably do pay too much for tickets as I pay for them way ahead of time to avoid missing the experience. I'm also very picky as to where I sit and this is achieved by buying ahead of time. Perhaps it boils down to what is more important to you - seeing the event and sitting where you want or saving money. As far as which is more packed (Christmas Eve or Christmas Day) try calling Ticketmaster and ask them which has more tickets available. Just a thought."
0,Thanks guys!
1,"I think both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be sold out. I saw it on Christmas Day 2 years ago, and it was packed.  It's a fun show though, very festive."
1,"Is it important to you that you see it on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day itself? If not, there is a 9 AM show on Saturday, the 27th -- and given the early hour, there might be greater availability of seats for that performance."
1,""";Is it important to you that you see it on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day itself? If not, there is a 9 AM show on Saturday, the 27th -- and given the early hour, there might be greater availability of seats for that performance."";    I guess it's not imperative that we see it on the 24th or 25th; it's just that I thought watching it after Xmas might not have the same effect?    Thanks for your input though, and thanks to you too Kate."
1,It's usually a busy week. What is your nightly budget (and reremember that taxes add 15% to the cost) and actual dates?
1,"I was hoping to find places for under $200/night. I see deals for $99/night - but when I look into them it turns out they don't apply to my dates, or they are for a motel far away from where I want to be."
2,That probably is the case... you don't want to stay in a place you find for $99 or they might put your 70 year old mother to work making beds.... You need to be realistic on your rates . That week is going to be expensive.
2,How old is your son? If he's 13 or under then the Eastgate Tower (affinia hotel) have a one bed room suite (2 beds) for $192 + taxes ($228 all in) but it's a pay in advance rate and non refundable. This room has a separate living area with a sofa bed.    If he's over 13 (then considered an adult) it's $232 + taxes ($274) and again it's pay in advance. Same room as above.    https:/
2,"$99 is a next to impossible price for a room in Manhattan let alone a room for 3 or a suite. Unless you're female ( I can't tell ) and will share the bedroom with your Mother while your son sleeps on a sofabed, I don't see how a suite will work.    There are only 2 suite hotels in/near the theater district- Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square and the Blakely hotel which has some 1 bedroom suites. Both will be much more money. The Metro Hotel has some family suites with 2 bedrooms but they are $295/night plus tax (15%) on those dates. I think your only hope of getting anything close to $99/night is staying outside Manhattan. How are you getting to NYC? If flying, which airport?"
1,Sorry I didn't read carefully. For under $200 you'll still have a hard time. Where/what are you seeing for $99? Probably not in Manhattan.
1,He is under 13. Thank you for that lead - I'll go check it out!
1,what is your budget in us dollars?
1,"Not really fussed. Maybe not over $400US. Would be happy with cheaper so I can shop, but I know it is an expensive time of year and very expensive city. Thanks"

0,"Super thanks you guys, l shall go and read all of these. I forget you don't have Boxing Day, do you get the day off as a bank holiday at least? Definitely need it ;)"
1,""";do you get the day off as a bank holiday at least?"";    We really don't refer to our holidays as bank holidays either, as far as I know. I think Federal Holiday is more often used.    But to answer your question it really depends on what day of the week Christmas is. I it is on a Sunday, many places will give Monday (26th) as a holiday. If Christmas is a Saturday, Friday (24th) will be a holiday.     For example in 2005, Christmas was a Sunday, so the Federal Holiday was Monday. What individual employers do depends on the business and   whether they are jerks or afraid of a revolt.    2005 Example  opm.gov/Operating_Status_Schedules/05.asp    If Christmas is a Tuesday, then just Tuesday is the holiday."

2,"I grew up in Houston and live in NJ now, so maybe I can provide some perspective on the weather. If you look in the list of top questions (on the right side of the NYC forum page), the 5th question is about weather. If you click on it, you'll get a table that shows the average high and low temperatures by month. For December, the average low is 32F and the average high is 42F. That's within the range of what you probably experience at some point ever winter in Louisiana.    If you're sightseeing, you might be moving from the cold outdoors to heated (or often overheated) spaces indoors repeatedly throughout the day. The typical advice for dealing with such conditions -- dress in layers, etc. -- applies. Also, consider the possibility that you might encounter some snow (not necessarily likely, but possible). You'll want a pair of boots just in case -- and they really should be waterproof, because the slushy puddles that form as the snow melts are often a bigger problem than the sn
ow itself.    What you should see while you're in NYC really depends on your interests, but don't let the cold weather stop you (unless you had your heart set on swimming the East River). If you get cold, stop for coffee / tea along the way and warm up."

0,"Show recommendations???"";"
1,For show recommendations---- go on www.broadwaybox.com and read the synopsis of each show... some are discounted some are not.... Have you seen anything at all in the theater and do you like plays or musicals... If you have seen something what did you like and what did you not like.
1,My 17 year-old son loved In the Heights.
2,"Off Broadway Fuerza Bruta is an amazing show that is perfect for teens. Dazzling lights, audience participation, anger management, it's just amazing:    www.youtube.com/watch?v=taBAtxasWto    Another great thing about this show is that the theater is in Union Square. Great place to come to after the show. The Heartland Brewery or Blue Water Grill are great places to eat. After dinner, hang out in the Square and watch New York go by."
2,"I highly recommend Toxic Avenger and Avenue Q. Lots of teen-tacky humor, but fun for adults, too! If they like South Park, they'll love these!! (And you'll be sooo cooooool!)    Both are playing at New World Stages on W. 50th Street, and are usually offered for discounts (either on line or at TKTS booths.)    Re: Rock of Ages - do they like 80's hair-band music? Or is it just you?    ;o)"
2,"DIdn't see Toxic Avenger, but Avenue Q is a winner. If you are sensitive to songs about porno, racism and teenage angst - or if muppet sex skeevs you out, this one may not be for you. But, I got world-wise city kids who both had a blast."
2,"The Lion King was out of this world, really amazing production. Im just back from NYC today - saw the show on Saturday in Minskoff theatre. Im 25 and my bf is 23 and we both LOVED it! I would def go and see it again. It's not to be missed and worth every penny!!"
1,"You can't go wrong with Shrek or The Lion King, regardless of the ages."
0,Edit on previous post - it should have read Wicked or The Lion King.    Sorry!!
2,I would also add Memphis to the list of shows teens would like. I can't wait to take my 15 and 17 yo daughters. I was able to get discounted tickets at Broadwaybox.com
2,"I recommend Wicked. Just saw it and it is full of great songs and wonderful stage, and the plot has a lot of teen issues like fitting in, bullying, and the fact that every story has 2 sides. Would love to take my teen."
1,"emg, ""; but if you are travelling with Delta......,""; can not tell what you mean. Are you talking about discount coupons, using a Delta AMEX credit card, etc."
2,"Re: Outlet Shopping\Discount Shopping.    We've visited Woodbury Common several Times on our previous 5 visits. It's around a 1 hour drive by coach from the Port authority Bus terminal. Ticketc cost around ТЃ40... it was 2 years since we last visited so it may have gone up. You'll have to factor the cost of traveling when thinking of the savings you may make.   Woodbury Common is HUGE!!, especially compared to any outlet malls in the UK. All the big names are there, Nike Adidas, Gucci, Channel, Under Armour Gap, Oakley, North Face... etc etc a Clothes Shoppers Paradise. The discounts are usually very good. Especially compared to UK prices. We found some great bargains in the North Face Store, saving nearly 80% on retail prices in the UK!!. CK, Armani and Diesel offered some similar bargains. It's definately worth a visit if your main aim is to shop till you drop..."
2,"Actually, many of the locals would say a trip to Woodbury is not worth the time and expense unless you're looking for very high end designer labels like Gucci, Prada, Chanel etc. which are hard to find at discount anywhere else. For regular moderate priced designers or basic clothing, you might just as well look at the discount stores in Manhattan (Loehmann's, Daffy's, Century 21 etc.) and serve yourselves the time and trouble of the trip. The regular stores are also always having sales to move stock in this recession. Dept. stores like Macy's and Bloomingdales offer visitors an 11% discount if you register at the service desk before shopping with proof you don't live here (driver's license is fine).     Have no idea what you're referring to with Delta. Perhaps it's an issue with where their terminal is located? In what context are these mentions? Can you provide a link?"
1,"Thank you all for your replies. I will probably just stay in the city to do clothes shopping as i only need a few outfits and i am not too bothered about "";designer names"";,    Cannot find the link referring to Delta but it was concerning terminals.!"
1,Woodbury is a nightmare I have had glad you are staying in the city!
2,"It was in the context of whether to take Airtrain or a cab from the airport. I mentioned how long the cab line is when you arrive at the Delta terminal late at night. The roadway under the terminal is narrow and the taxi dispatcher is an idiot. The cab drivers tell me they're sitting in a lot waiting for the dispatcher to call them to the terminal when there is a long line... The last time I landed there I actually begged the guy to call the lot and he refused! Meanwhile, black cars line up to illegally solicit rides, blocking the few cabs who want to get through. Its a mess and my comment was to always do Airtrain when possible.    I fly Delta a lot, by choice - because they let you prebook exit rows, fly to where I'm going and are usually reasonably priced. This past year, I've pretty much flown Delta and Jet Blue exclusively.... The only time Delta is bad is if you have to go via Atlanta and the flights change giving you 40 minutes to transit there."
0,"HI Evening, thanks for clearing that up. I was beginning to think that i  imagined reading your post.!!"
0,"that happens to me all the time - then I have to figure out what post that "";aside""; was in...."
2,"The crown access is sold out months in advance and can only be gotten through the official web site.... With the passes you have you are going to have long wait. If you have not ordered the passes yet I would not do so, especially the 7 day one... It is overpriced and the admission info they tell you about not  accurate. For most people it is not the way to go"
2,"What do you mean we'll have a long wait? I thought we could skip the ticket line and get straight in the (very long) waiting line?    This is what it says on the website:  "";Free round-trip ferry ticket. New York Pass allows you to skip the ticket purchase line by presenting your Pass at the Eastern National bookstore inside Castle Clinton National Monument to receive your ticket for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry."";    We haven't ordered them yet and if I have my full "";intinerary""; I'll see wath would be cheaper. But the biggest plus about the NY Pass to me was that we could skip some lines and save some time. (ESB,TotR)"
2,Most people who go to the statue have timed tickets for the boat... everyone else gets in line.... the last person who wrote about the NY PAss said they were not able to skip any lines and if you are not going to have a monument pass there is really not much reason to go to the island... Others who have been watching this will chime in . I would not rely on NY PAss to give you the information because they are trying to sell you something... I would look at the official statecruises web site and see what they say about people with this pass. The longer line at ESB is through security not the ticket line and I don't think you can skip that one either. I know on those passes they list the fee to enter the Met Museum as $20 when in fact it is always pay what you wish and many other places they list have free days..  The real danger of the passes is that people become slaves to it and feel they have to make back their investment. That is not the best way to see the city.
1,"I've checked the Statuecruises website but they don't say anything about the pass, but that's allright, you've helped me out fine.     I'll think twice about getting those passes, I think you're right with the "";becoming a slave to the pass""; thing."
2,If it helps you out the only real lines that people talk about are the SOL and ESB. The other places rarely have lines.... I also would not get a timed ticket for the ESB because it is so weather dependent... You don't want to go up there unless it is a clear day/// like today for instance is cloudy and rainy and it would be a waste of time.... For those kinds of sights you can always go to Top of the Rock where there rarely is a line.
2,"We recently did this with the NY pass. The queue you can avoid is the one to buy tickets, NY pass holders get their tickets from the bookstore inside Clinton monument. We got ours the day before, got up early the next day and got on the first ferry at 8:30 am. We went into the monument on our ticket, didn't have to buy anything extra."
1,elevonic--- Once you got your ticket were you just meshed in with those that held time tickets for 8:30 or was there a separate line ? This time of year is not as crowded as the summer but I was wondering how they handled that.
1,"bilmin - the time I got there we were the first ones there! So don't know if there was another line at all, although I suspect there wasn't. The only advantage I could see with the NY pass was if there was a queue to buy your actual ticket, not queue for the security check etc."
1,There are discounts for this show all the time. You just have to find them. If you find one of the 2 for 1 specials for your date I would grab them.
2,Those advance purchase tickets deals likely won't be available for your dates soon - they just started coming out for November shows. try: broadwaybox.com ; theatremania.com and playbill.com . Might see 25% off come out first but you can afford to wait for better as there will be discount tickets available at tkts day of the show. I see it almost every year during peeak times and always buy my tickets at the tkts booth and have always gotten excellent seats.
2,I agree I don't think you'll find discount tickets to buy in advance for those dates. The discounts tend to be for Nov. You can wait until you arrive and get same day tickets at one of the TKTS booths. The theater is large and sitting further back is actually better than sitting close.
2,"I received an early invitation to buy tickets last month. Non-peak shows are listed at 11 am. 2,5 and 8pm for Dec 15-16. Same shows are non-peak on the 17th with the exception of 8pm show which is peak show as are all other shows till the end of Dec. You probably would not have a problem waiting to buy tickets if you are flexible and go to a day-time non-peak show. If you want to go 18th, 19th or 20th I would buy now. I usually attend the second week of Dec., there is always empty seats here and there. I splurge and buy good seats, you want to be on the first level, I tried the second mezz and nope, not the same. Orch/1st mezz are $105. Non-peak orch/1st mezz are $75. Premium tickets avail too, but the Orch/1st mezz have been great. My offer was buy one ticket get one free. But only for non-peak shows Nov 13-25 and the 30th. code DMBOGO purchase before 10/30."
2,"Waiting is definitely the best thing to do for cheaper, better seats. This is a large venue and they put on as many as 3 shows per day.     Weekday and morning / early afternoon performances are probably better for discounts. We went to a Tuesday 11:00 am show ( Dec 16 ) the week before 25th holiday.    Here is what I experienced. Premium tickets were going for $90 each in November. In early Dec prices for same seats were lowered to ~$70. Soon after that they offered 2 for the price of one, so we had 4 very good seats for just ~$150.    And there were still a lot of empty seats in the theatre."
1,"If they don't, they'll get you one. ;) They do offer overnight shoe shine and robes and slippers."
0,And the winner of the most random question of the day is....
0,Now Mel--- I am surprised you did not tell the OP where in Park Slope they could buy that shoe horn rather than pack that heavy item in their luggage. Perhaps they were afraid of being tagged as the shoe horn bomber.
0,Well - I'm fessing up - if a hotel doesn't; provide shoe horns - I'm taking my business elsewhere!!!!  This is unconscionable - I mean - what are they thinking?  Poppa
0,"Well, a shoe horn after all is one of those items one can't possibly pack in one's suitcase...would take up way too much space!"
1,"Random is me through and through I'm afraid.    Well the thing is I bought a pair of shoes the other day, no lace type, and for the first time ever I have required the need for a shoe horn. I'm quite easily pleased. I purchased one at a store in my home town, but its quite boring and plain, so I am hoping as the trump is the next big hotel I am staying at will have one with their emblem on it.     p.s. I am not planning on taking the said shoes to NYC!!! ha ha"
0,Perhaps we should alert the Trump organization that one of the members of the notorious shoe horn swipers is planning their next heist in NYC.  Is INTERPOL still in existence?  You know a shoe horn with a logo works much better than a plain old generic model!  Perhaps a carefully worded inquiry to the hotel would be in order from the OP.  As long as it doesn't tip them off!  This is really amusing..........at least he/she doesn't want to know who's buried in Grant's tomb.  Poppa
2,"If you are not taking said shoes to NY........Why do you need a shoe horn?    I think there is more to this request than meets the eye, or the foot for that matter"

1,I have no idea what you mean by observe his Italian history. Unless you mean to post in the Italy forum.     Maybe you mean something like the Tenement Museum?  http://tenement.org/    Which is of course the American history of (mostly) European immigrants.
2,"Do you mean you want to focus on Italian-American heritage sights in NYC?

"";"
2,"Little Italy can be a tourist trap. It's crowded, the restaurants are overpriced and the area is shrinking more and more as Chinatown takes it over block by block. It's hard to say one wants an Italian experience in NYC because it's such a melting pot. It's great to come to NYC to explore many cultures of the people who live here. You can come and hear 10 different languages spoken in the streets every day. Italian history is all over the five boroughs. But, to be specific, you have Arthur Ave up in the Bronx, the Middle Village neighborhood of Queens, Bensonhurst and Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn. There is even an Italian American Heritage Museum on Mulberry St in Little Italy. Buon viaggio!"
2,"There aren't too many other places with a view. One if By Land is very romantic, no view but it's in an old carriage house in Greenwich Village. Roaring fire, piano, etc. I was disappointed with the food, however.     The View is the revolving restaurant at the top of the Marriot Marquis. I think it's overpriced but you could go there for a drink or dessert to get your view."

1,"It's rare to get a combination of a view AND good food. Honestly, I would sacrifice the view for dinner: you'll have plenty of other opportuinities to see the city, and wouldn't you rather focus on looking at your partner for your anniversary? You could take a trip up the ESB or across the Brooklyn Bridge AFTER dinner if you really want a view to be a part of your evening."

2,"*** We were looking for a good mix of great view, romantic, and good food for our anniversary dinner ***    Okay .... similar to the River Cafe is the 'Water's Edge' in LIC. It also sits right on the water with a pretty nice view of the 59th Street Bridge and midtown Manhattan (Empire State Bldg., Chrysler Bldg. and UN). The surrounding area in LIC is not as nice as B'klyn Heights but there used to be a private ferry that can take you across the East River from Manhattan right to the restaurant dock.   The property was just bought by an Asian restaurant group but I think I read they also bought the ferry boat. The whole restaurant has just been renovated after the sale, so I have not had a chance to see what the new owners did with the place. But the for food, view and romance ..... this might fit the bill.  http://www.watersedgenyc.com/"
0,"Yep, I heard that Water's Edge changed hands and has improved. (I actually enjoyed my one dinner there about 10 years ago, and the view is great, so it seems like a good option.) I'm going to a wedding there in June.    I agree with BrooklynBrdge - focus on the food and atmo for dinner, enjoy the view later going to the top of the ESB or TOTR, or at a rooftop bar or even on the Staten Island Ferry.    Even the food is not the best, the atmo and view at Metrazur is stunning. It's located on the balcony of the main hall of Grand Central Terminal. Awesome!"

Coming across Xmas trees in certain areas, ie Wall Street, Lincoln Ctr    Nearer the time on New York Tourist info websites, they will list exactly what is happening and when.

It's aimed at kids but as long as you're young at heart you'll enjoy the story of Christmas. We've seen that 3 times now so this year we have opted for White Christmas at the Marquis theatre instead.     The rockefeller tree and ice rink is a must see and there are some nice restaurants overlooking the ice rink for dinner and lunch.     Central park is lovely in winter, one year it snowed when we were there and it just looked like a postcard.     if you go to see Grand Central Station there is a lovely Christmas Market in the Vanderbuilt Hall which is worth a visit.     And of course the window displays on 5th Avenue and Macys are great.     if you have any question, please get in touch."

2,"My personal must is a Staten Island Ferry ride in the early evening when it is just darks and the skyline buildings are lit up for Christmas.     If it is very cold, you can stay indoors and look out the windows, but you can also go out on deck. Bring some hot chocolate!    Also check out the Neopolitan christmas tree at Met Museum and consider a visit to the Cloisters, the Met's medieval art collection in Washington Heights which is decorated for Xmas,and sometimes has live holiday music.    Check out local churches for special (and quite lovely) holidays servicesand concerts. Worth it"
0,Thank you all so much for your suggestions - i'm going to file them safely :)
2,"The Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn may be a bit of a schlep to get to, but the lights put the Rockefeller Center Tree to shame. To set the stage, this is a neighborhood of single family homes that compete to see who has the biggest and most outlandish decorations. We're talking life sized mechanical men, snow globes and enough electricity usage to power a small city. I know that there are tour buses that come here when the lights are happening. To get you psyched - check out this website [especially the photos].    out.com/od/ker_heights02-jpg.htm"
2,"First, make sure that the apartment you found is not a scam - many apartment rentals in NYC are.    As much as I love Brooklyn, I usually advise 1st time visitors to stay in Midtown Manhattan to get to know the island a little. But since you will be attending a festival, and the price sounds too good to be true (I'm extremely skeptical of this deal, please tell me you didn't find it on Craigslist) it will be more convenient for you to stay in Brooklyn. And in Manhattan will cost you probably 4 times as much for your number of people.    Good luck and let us know if the lodging works out - check ripoffreport.com or Google the company name, make sure there are no horror stories.    And pay with a credit card!"
2,"nope, not on Craigslist.  It was on homeaway and from what I can see they appear to be legitimate (I have looked at several independant reviews of the site.)  The woman who is renting it out says that she is running a special and it's usually about an extra $50 a night from what I can tell.  It seemed a little too good to be true for me as well, but from the looks of homeaway at least legit (I have also looked the name of the person doing this rental up on the white pages and they do have a residence at that address which I feel is a positive sign - surely a scammer would have a fake address?) and homeaway also offers internet fraud protection up to $1000 (which is what we're being asked to pay)  That all SEEMS pretty good to me, but if there's anything I'm not thinking of, please let me know!  The festival is over three nights (four including an after party). We still want to see as much of NYC as possible, and saving the money on the accomodation will help us do that... unless 
of course, the extra expense of staying in Manhattan will be negated by not taking subway/taxis etc"
2,"If you could give us the address it would be helpful. I have a friend who lives in Clinton Hill and it's one of those pockets of Brooklyn that does not have easy public transportation alternatives - for instance she has to take a bus to the subway.    The only train I know that runs through Clinton Hill is the "";G""; and that only along Lafayette Ave - so check where you will be in relationship to that.     And finally, Clinton Hill is between Ft Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and there are intermittent sketchy blocks in the area and wonderful block in the area."
2,"According to Google maps we are right near the C train and the G train (both walking distance) We're about 2 blocks from Franklin Ave station location wise.     Hope that helps with whether the area is okay    I've tried a few landmarks around NYC in google maps and they all say its about a half an hour by subway.  None of us are too concerned by that really, we're in Australia - you can't get anywhere in less than half an hour here :)"
1,"You shouldn't be taking cabs in NYC during the day as it takes just a little bit longer on the subway, and sometimes shorter!    I am sure you will be taking cabs at night after partying to get back to the apartment at 2am, but that's par for the course."
1,"My problem with the HomeAway site was that the owner of the flat I had booked decided to give it to someone else two weeks before my group was due to arrive. The HomeAway staff was sympathetic but did nothing.    Although I was sent my deposit back, I had to frantically look for an alternative in mid August when all the best flats and hotel rooms have gone.    I would not recommend using HomeAway because their contracts only protect the owners of the properties: if the renter cancels his booking, he loses his deposit, if the owner cancels that's just tough luck for the renter!"
2,"You can pick up a special Game Day bus to Ralph Wilson Stadium:   http://www.nfta.com/metro/gameday-bills.asp    Niagara Falls is about 20 minutes from downtown Buffalo. You can enjoy the falls from the U.S. side, but if you want to go see the Canadian falls, you won't need a passport -- all you'll need is a birth certificate and a government-issued photo ID.    I'll let someone else answer your casino questions."
1,Thanks. Can you recommend a hotel that is close to the metro station downtown so we can hop the metro to go to the game?     The game is November 17----what weather should I expect?
2,"You can expect the same weather in Buffalo as you get in Cleveland. We get your weather probably the day after you get it (from the west). It could rain, it could snow, it could be a nice, sunny day... who knows!    Regarding hotels downtown, here's a list from a previous post:  1) Hampton Inn  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d224389-  2) Adam's Mark  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d93115-R  3) Hyatt Regency Hotel  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d93122-R  4) Comfort Suites  tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60974-d93128-R  You can catch the train on Main Street and it's free as long as you stay above ground. The bus station where you will most likely catch the shuttle to the game is near Main and N. Division St, across from Church St.     Niagara Falls: The Seneca Niagara Casino is within walking distance of the actual Falls. If it's a nice day and you feel like walking, it's an easy walk to the Canadian side across the Rainbow Bridge. Just brin
g you birth cert and driver's license so they let you back into the USA.    There is a casino in downtown Bflo, but it's nothing special, from what I've been told."
2,"the metro train does not go out to ralph wilson stadium. the stadium is in orchard park, about 25 min south of buffalo. (you'll pass it on the 90 as you drive up)if you drive to the game, leave your hotel early as traffic can get thick. consider driving, tailgating is art in buffalo! it's a lot of fun to experience. i would recommend the hampton inn. good central location for night life."
1,"Don't waste your time or money at the Canadian casinos. The slots are VERY tight and you will never see a minimum below 15/20$. Also, if you're a smoker, they are non-smoking and do NOT offer free drinks, whereas the Seneca casino on the US side does.      Go Bills! Boo Browns!"
1,"No offense to Gear but the Canadian Casinos are far superior to the Seneca if your motivation is a nice atmoshphere, shopping, and beauty. I can not speak for the gambling outcomes. To the Seneca's credit , they have great restaurants and a very nice concert venue. If you are into casinos, I would check out both...."
2,"Thanks for all of your advice.     We went ahead and booked the Country Inn near the Falls in Canada for 3 nights (I figure we can check out the Falls since the only time I was there was when I was a toddler).      We'll drive back on Monday and check in to the hotel in Hamburg (Holiday Inn....cheap) and then go over to the stadium early for some tailgating. It looks like it's only about 5 miles away, so even with crazy traffic I'm hoping its not too big of a headache.     Is alcohol permitted in the parking lot? Little gas grills? And what about the restroom situation----are there port-o-johns available?? And how soon do they open the stadium?      Thanks so much for all of your help!"
1,"drinks-yes, grills-yes, the lots open at the crack of dawn....it is full contact tailgaiting in Buffalo and I think after experiencing it, you will change your team affiliation. After going to a few Browns games...I believe Buffalo has the tailgaiting title...but it is very close.....Go Toronto...oh I mean Buffalo....!!"
2,"You should check with the car rental company about their policy regarding the border-crossing into Canada. Other people have asked about that question in this forum, and I can't recall the answer, but if you do a search, you should be able to find those posts.     Our weather is quite variable at that time of year. The roads may be perfectly dry, or we may have a lot of snow. In any case, no one uses chains, and in fact I think they are illegal these days because of the damage they do to the roads. Your rental car will be equipped with all-weather tires, and that's all you'll need.    Even if it's quite snowy, the road crews are experienced in keeping the highways plowed and salted. Just maintain a safe speed. If the weather is very bad, you might need to postpone your trip if you are not experienced with driving on snow or ice. Also, be sure to take a travel kit with energy bars, some bottled water, a blanket, and a fully charged cell phone against the (unlikely) possibility th
at you'll get stranded.    Generally, American drivers who have insurance on their own vehicles are covered for any damage to the rental vehicle and do not need to buy the supplemental insurance offered by the rental companies -- but I'm not sure whether that's the case for someone coming from another country. You should check with your insurance company in the U.K. about their policy. At any rate, the charge for the supplemental insurance isn't too great.    Finally, because you are traveling over the holidays, do be especially careful on the roads and try to avoid traveling late at night if at all possible. You're going to be doing a lot of driving! The trip from Buffalo to New York City is about seven hours, so, especially if the weather is bad, allow yourself plenty of time for slowdowns due to holiday traffic, weather delays, etc., especially if you have a flight to catch in NYC.    Good luck, and enjoy your visit!"
1,Thanks very much. Lots of great info there :). We are waiting to hear from Budget car rental now regarding border crossings etc.
1,When will you be coming? There are some great seasonal activities.
0,We will be there August 22-24. Thanks!
2,"Well, you're really in luck, because there's a lot going on, including the Elmwood Avenue Festival of the Arts (http://www.elmwoodartfest.org), with special activities for youngsters, performances (including one by Nikki Hicks, one of my favorite local vocalists), and food of all kinds. Elmwood Avenue is one of the area's most colorful and thriving neighborhoods, and very walkable.    The Buffalo Irish Festival is also going on that weekend -- in Hamburg, as it happens, at the fairgrounds: www.buffaloirish.com/irishfestival.htm.    You could also visit the Buffalo Zoo, take a cruise on the Miss Buffalo, attend a baseball game at Dunn Tire Park downtown (free fireworks after the games on Fridays), and attend the free evening activities at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery (also on Elmwood Ave.) on Friday night. (On the 22nd, the Gallery fun includes hands-on art projects and live music ranging from klezmer to gypsy.)    I'll add more ideas as I think of them, and I'm sure other p
eople will add their favorite activities. Have fun!"
2,"Depending on your time frame, a quick trip to Niagara Falls would be great. It is a 45 minute drive from Hamburg and well worth the investment of time. Otherwise you have some beaches in Angola to enjoy. If the girls like to shop you have the Galleria, which is a great expansive Mall. If you enjoy a more eclectic afternoon, lunch on Elmwood Avenue, a stroll through the Albright Know Art gallery, and hitting some of the hip shops would be a cool afternoon. Darien Lake Theme Park is 40 minutes from Hamburg if an amusement park is your thing, Marine Land in the Falls is pretty interesting as well."
0,What great suggestions - thanks everyone!!!
1,"There is not much to do in Buffalo, your better off crossing the border into canada and going there."
1,Well I must respectfully disagree. We had a great time in Buffalo. There was absolutely no need to leave the country!
2,"Glad to hear it, Marykayeee! Do tell if you have time - we'd love to hear about your trip."
1,Thanks you for sharing....    more reasons to come a day early and take in all that is Buffalo.......
2,"Good to know; sorry to hear about the poor customer service. I think the only Bflo Airport lot that really is within walking distance is the shot term lot, which obviously wouldn't work for a 10 day trip. When the airport was re-built, they didn't plan for the large crowds that have appeared, many like you, from Canada. They didn't consider that market would be so great!     How rude that people were cutting in line to exit - who would let such people in front of them? I sure wouldn't... get to the back of the line where you belong - you're just not that special!     I think it is just as well off to park across the street at one of the private lots. I think they also have coupons, occasionally. The last time I parked long term across the street, the lots were so full that they just let people drop their car in a line near the entrance, and they parked it for you. Their shuttle buses seem to run more frequently than the Bflo Airport shuttle buses. Here is the link for Sunpar

2,"Since the letter is from the hotel directly, I get the impression that they plan to enforce the intention of the policy. My thoughts have always been that these discounts were for folks traveling on gov't business..not a just a deal for gov't employees. AAA, AARP dicounts rarely top 10% whereas gov't and military can be as deep as 30-50% off the rack rate.     You could just play dumb and take your chances...."
1,Thank you for your response. I have been asking for and getting the military discount going on 20 years at various hotels and have never been asked for this documentation. The discount I received was only about $18 less a nite than the AAA rate. What makes me upset is that I made these reservations in August and I just got the letter!
1,"Can you find the hotel chain's policy in writing, like on the website?"
1,Interesting...    I do think it is odd that they would ask for this so far after the initial reservation was posted... I would contact the hotel for an explanation. What sort of Id have most the hotels required in the past...I am wondering now if I qualify as a government employee...I would love to tap into those rates.....
2,"One of the perks of being in the military are the discounts - all you need to show is your id card. (except in this instance). I contacted Hilton Customer Assistance regarding this matter and they were very professional and helpful about my concerns. The manager of the Buffalo-Amherst property contacted me and offered me a discount off of the rack rate, but will not honor the reservation rate. Hilton corporate stated that each property can make up their own policies regarding rates. This is a very bad business practice if they change the terms of the reservation."
2,"Are you looking for the ocean or the bay?    Depending on where you are in Sag Harbor, the nearest beach is Long Beach in North Haven. You drive over the bridge in town, and make a left at the circle. There is also Havens Beach, which is ideal for children. If you want the ocean, you'll have to travel to East Hampton or Southampton. There are numerous beaches to choose from in East Hampton."
2,"If it is the soft sands of an ocean beach you want there are a number of options in both Southampton and East Hampton towns, each within easy distance of Sag Harbor. Bridgehampton's Scott Cameron Beach may be the closest for you, at about a fifteen minute drive. Do read signs before you park at any beach or you may get a ticket - or worse, get towed, unless it is after six pm.     Beaches with lifeguards, which I am assuming you will want, usually sell day passes. Call 631-283-6000 for Southampton's Town Hall to find out where to go in that town and East Hampton's for their list.     Coopers Beach on the ocean in Southampton Village is a very nice family beach with bathrooms and a snack bar. It was recently voted one of the top beaches in America - unfortunately for us as it is attracting many new visitors. I believe it still sells day passes, but I hear they can sell out on busy days. Call Village Hall to find out more: 631-283-0247."
2,"There are many different beaches here in sag harbor. There is mecox beach, scott cameron, ocean road beach, and sagg main are the closet to the ocean. we also have Long beach. wich is in sag hrbor, try and go anytime after 5 or six when there is no parking restrictions, other wise you'll need a beach sticker/day pass. but there will be no life gaurds. you could also travel out to east hampton/ amagansett and montauk."
1,How nice is the Sag Harbor Bay beach area? Water and sand clean? I think it's mostly private over there
2,There are some nice beaches in Sag Harbor. The sand at Long Beach (officially called Fosters Beach) is nice although I've never been swimming there so can't say about the water. There's also a beach due east of the village called Haven's Beach. These have very calm water-no waves.    http://www.sagharborchamber.com/beaches.htm
