"The only thing to be concerned about with boxing day is that it's also a Saturday this year, and the trains do run somewhat less frequently on Saturdaty. But not so that it'll cause you any problems."
"Thanks for all your replies, you have been a great help."
"Oh, I forgot to add, stay is for 8 nights, end of April, therefore could I expect prices to drop further at those 2 places or is it recommended that I just book now?"
thank you all very much! im checking into those you listed now! we were looking for a location that is about midtown so that if its could we could easily go put our shopping bags in our room. Are any that you listed in midtown or conveniently located?
"You don't say which airport you're coming from, so I am generalising a bit here..     It should take no more than 90 minutes to get from either JFK or EWR to your hotel. (I'm unsure if you're staying at the Marriot Marquis, as you just say "";midtown hotel""; or just going for a buffet!!).    Anyway, 2pm - 3.45pm to get to hotel, give yourself an hour and a quarter to get freshened up, changed, and relax which makes it now 5pm.     So, IMO, you've actually got 3 hours before the tickets at 8pm, (give or take half an hour, as you'll probably have to get their earlier.     As I said, these are huge generalisations, as I'm unsure what airport, and what transportation options you're taking, and also where you're actually staying."
Flying into LGA and staying at the Benjamin. The whole family was in NY in June so we still remember how to get around pretty well and still have current maps of subway ect. My daughter and I are in love with NY and couldn't wait to get back.
How long will you be in the City? Perhaps you should save thew Marriott for another time - when you will not have to rush.  Just a thought.  Poppa
You should have no trouble with that time frame.
